        <h1 id="order"><a href="#order">The Order</a></h1>
        <p>
          Concordia Order is a millennia old, international order of knights whose foundation and practice is rooted in
          tradition despite the persistence of the order into the modern day. Prior to the manifestation of the plague
          and the apocalypse of the world, the Order’s primary duty was to defend global order and justice through
          service to the world’s population. They sought to promote the well-being of all peoples, and maintain
          international peace and security through widespread cooperation. Such a task was believed to have been the
          will of the magic that coursed through everyone, and the knights the tools of this will.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <a href="/concordia-order/assets/emblems/concordiaorder.png" target="_blank">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="/concordia-order/assets/emblems/concordiaorder.png">
          </a>
          <figcaption><em>The Order’s emblem. Two halves with an ‘awakened’ light when whole.</em></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Today, this duty and hope for peace persists. The Order acts as something between Interpol and the Jedi (to
          provide some points of reference). They continue to fight international crime but are meant to be
          peacekeepers, not soldiers, as they tend to the magical balance of the world and maintain the flow of magic
          currents in hopes to prevent another apocalyptic event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Order is also responsible for global safety and stasis regarding magical phenomena, primarily in relation
          to the plague. Knights are the only individuals with magic to cleanse tangled areas and people. For this
          reason the Order claims the budding return of access to mythos forms must be limited to their own ranks, but
          because of this tightly kept leash, tensions around and opinions of knights range globally. Still, they are
          present worldwide for smaller feats too, like dealing with bestowed objects. Due to people not having direct
          access to magic on an individual level anymore, encounters with enchanted objects can be dangerous because of
          general ignorance. In these situations, knights also step in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mass recruiting through means of conscription was not uncommon in the Order in the centuries prior to the
          apocalypse. Now, the order is made up almost entirely of volunteers (many joining due to the desire to gain
          access to their true selves), though conscription of nonviolent criminals, or destitute individuals sometimes
          still occurs as a formality to provide these people with means of rehabilitation or livelihood. However, those
          seeking to volunteer would make their way to the Order’s headquarters, likely by way of a knight-maintained
          outpost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knight-recruits come to live on the isle that houses said headquarters while they train, with needs like food
          and housing met. They are trained in combat, philosophy, and magical theory. A recruit will not gain access to
          a mythos form unless they are deemed worthy of graduating to a full-fledged knight and earning the (rather
          ceremonial in this age) title of ‘Ser.’
        </p>
        <p>
          Once graduated, a knight is paid a monthly stipend based on their rank. Knights no longer have to live on the
          isle, though many do. All active knights live near some manner of Order outpost spread across the world,
          though the level of upkeep varies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knights who have volunteered can elect to leave the Order at any time, but may not return upon being retired.
        </p>

          <figcaption><em>Knight uniforms. Standard knights are not required to wear uniforms at all times, and most
              often don’t when on assignment that does not involve a necessary level of presentation. Knights are
              expected to adorn some measure of identifiable apparel when monitoring an outpost, and must be in full
              uniform for traditional ceremonies or event appearances. Their cloaks are entirely ornamental. Specific
              tailoring can be adjusted, like the length of sleeves and the type of shirt collar, but colors
              cannot.</em></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2 id="partners"><a href="#partners">Partners</a></h2>
        <p>
          In order to be assigned a partner, a knight must express interest to higher ups. Consideration will begin for
          an appropriate assignment and, if found, the pair will be made and begin additional training together. A
          knight will never choose their own partner, though it is possible for partners to have a preexisting
          relationship, such as siblings, friends, or romantic partners. It is also just as possible for partners to
          have never met and be expected to succeed regardless. There are no standards for the age, gender, or type of
          mythos that may make up a duo, aside from the fact that partners will always be taught opposing inheritances.
          Knights will not graduate to senior knights as a fully formed pair until able to fully embrace one of these
          two schools of magic and thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only extreme cases will see an established pair reassigned to new partners. A knight may be reassigned if
          their partner dies, but many who have experienced this particular loss go years without requesting a new
          partner.
        </p>

        <h2 id="inheritances"><a href="#inheritances">Inheritances</a></h2>
        <p>
          Inheritances are unique magic practices developed by the order for the sole purpose of cleansing tangled
          magic. Their details are a well-guarded secret, and in order to be promoted to the senior ranking and be
          assigned a partner, knights must magically swear themselves to said secrecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two inheritances are the school of Heaven, and the school of Earth, after the two source wells of magic. A
          knight training to be a senior knight is assigned to the inheritance they will more easily be able to mentally
          and physically embrace wholeheartedly. Successfully accomplishing cleansing magic is to join your own magic to
          tangled heaven or earth currents, and unravel it back to your own signature. Because of the threat of losing
          yourself to the wild magic’s persuasion, a knight’s magic is linked to a partner of the opposing inheritance
          to either keep them afloat, or keep them grounded.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h2 id="tokens"><a href="#tokens">Tokens</a></h2>
        <p>
          A pair of knights are linked together by use of enchanted pieces of jewelry known as tokens. All senior
          knights and above must wear their tokens while on duty; wearing them otherwise is up to the user. Tokens may
          be items handcrafted to a recruit’s taste by an Order smith, or belongings handed over to the Order forge upon
          the start of a knight’s senior training. Tokens must be fairly easy to remove, like a necklace, earring,
          bracelet, or ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon senior promotion, paired knights are granted their near-complete tokens, which are finalized by smiths
          severing a small piece of a user’s magic and tying it to their partner’s token. This process creates a feed of
          base level thoughts and emotions between the pair, and allows cleansing magic to be safely performed. In cases
          of extreme emotion or thought, a knight may be overwhelmed by their partner’s will, but the magic bond is
          generally viewed as a strength by the Order, allowing a pair to act as an extension of each other when
          necessary rather than two separate parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tokens are also enchanted to allow knights to create and pass through gates.
        </p>

        <h2 id="gates"><a href="#gates">Gates</a></h2>
        <p>
          A gate is a magical doorway that allows a user to teleport back to a token’s ‘home base’ setting. A knight’s
          token will either be set to return them to the Home Gate, a monument in the heart of the Order’s headquarters
          on Arthen Isle, or to the outpost in which they report to on a daily basis. In order to open a gate a knight
          only has to muster the desire to do so, and then step through any archway or opening that has no
          interruptions. Knights can send others through the gate before themselves, but the magic will die as soon as
          the caster passes through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Home Gate has the unique ability to send those who pass beneath it to any archway or opening in the world, but
          all other gates return those who pass through to the casting token’s established home base.
        </p>

        <h2 id="outposts"><a href="#outposts">Outposts</a></h2>
        <p>
          Outposts are Order establishments outside of Arthen Isle. They are sites of recovery, hospice, and transport
          for those who need it, and places where civilians can request the assistance of their local knights. Not every
          request is honored; knights assist as they see capable without breaking their pledge to be unbiased servants
          rather than political soldiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The size of outposts and the amount of knights serving them vary based on the size of the community they are
          hosted in or around. Outposts are often decorated with, or nearby shrines depicting mythos who lived before
          the apocalypse. In many cases, the identities of these figures are unknown. They could be knights who became
          legends in the area, members of long-established families, or maybe even holy figures from a time when a
          pantheon could have been more diverse.
        </p>

        <h2 id="tapestries"><a href="#tapestries">Tapestries</a></h2>
        <p>
          A fancy word for what is far better described as threads, tapestries are strings imbued with a fragment of a
          knight’s magic. This fraction is harvested when a knight-recruit graduates. While the strings may look like
          nothing to the average individual, if correctly prompted, the string can weave itself into a tapestry that
          depicts the subject’s life in such a way that honors them. There is a hall in which tapestries of the fallen
          are displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unknown to all but higher ups in the Order and those tasked to care for the tapestries, the strings can be
          read through physical touch by those trained to do so. This ability allows the Order to track knight
          whereabouts through the connection to their personal magic signatures.
        </p>

        <h1 id="ranks"><a href="#ranks">Ranks</a></h1>
        <p>
          The following is listed from the lowest ranking knight tier, to the highest ranking knight tier. Any of the
          following standard knights may also request to be smiths, allowing them the opportunity to learn how to forge
          tokens. All knights of this division that are senior knight rank or higher have partners.
        </p>

        <h2>Knight-Recruit</h2>
        <p>
          Anyone in the ranks of the Order that has not yet gone through their graduation ceremony and consequently not
          yet earned the title of 'Ser'. Recruits live at the Order's headquarters on Arthen Isle, following set
          routines that govern their training. Recruits do not get access to their mythos form.
        </p>
        <h2>Knight</h2>
        <p>
          Along with senior knights, the rank with the highest numbers. Knights have graduated to earn the title of
          ‘Ser,’ and are ‘awoken’ to have access to their mythos forms, though they have not been assigned a partner.
          They vary greatly in age and experience, as some opt never to partner and rank higher. Knights are sent out
          into the world to fulfill any Order duties unrelated to the plague, which they cannot assist in cleansing
          without a partner. Often, these duties revolve around public service and maintaining outposts.
        </p>
        <h2>Senior Knight</h2>
        <p>
          Along with knights, the rank with the highest numbers. Senior knights are knights who have been assigned a
          partner and can now perform cleansing magic on areas and individuals afflicted by wild magic. Senior knights,
          because of the level of distinction they have earned from their fellow knights, are often entrusted with work
          of a more dangerous or important nature when necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>Knight Constable</h2>
        <p>
          Knights who have earned the right to lead small groups of their fellow knights. They are often under the order
          of knight commanders, who send them off to oversee missions on a case by case basis. It is not uncommon for
          them to have a specific territory they are most assigned to.
        </p>
        <h2>Knight Commander</h2>
        <p>
          A high honor, and generally the highest achievement most knights ever earn. Knight commanders have the
          authority to oversee small, defined territories throughout the world, sending out small numbers of teams to
          patrol and act as needed.
        </p>
        <h2>High Constable</h2>
        <p>
          Knights serving the first knight much in the same way that knight constables serve commanders. They are often
          the voices of the first knight throughout the world and the isle, making appearances and speaking on their
          better’s behalf as needed.
        </p>
        <h2>First Knight</h2>
        <p>
          The head of the Order. In theory it should be a single pair of knights, but the current First predates the
          introduction of pairs and has never gone through a pairing ceremony. When deceased or retired however, a pair
          of high constables will replace her. A First’s duties revolve around overseeing the network of knights in
          their command, though little is publicly known about the minutiae of inner workings.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h1 id="specializations"><a href="#specializations">Specializations</a></h1>
        <p>
          The following are subgroups of knights with more tailored duties within the Order, who do not see to the
          standard duties of other knights. They receive access to mythos forms, and can rise in ranks within their
          division, but do not receive individual partners and as a result are not taught, nor can they perform,
          cleansing magic.
        </p>

        <h2 id="keepfleet"><a href="#keepfleet">Keepfleet</a></h2>
        <p>
          A division of the order responsible for global mail delivery. While communities have their own local postal
          services, Keepfleet knights deal with global deliveries via outposts, and are especially equipped to deal with
          the delivery of magical items. Postal knights, affectionately referred to as posties, naturally maintain trade
          routes and are also commonly requested in service of deliveries that have important political or economical
          associations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Posties are allowed to travel freely through most territories, and can sometimes be seen with standard knights
          if expected to cross into areas of question or danger.
        </p>

              as they need to be easily identifiable as they pass through territories, both for their own safety and to
              make their availability of service known. Their cloaks act largely as protection from inclement weather.
              Specific tailoring can be adjusted, like the length of sleeves and the type of shirt collar, but colors
              cannot.</em></figcaption>

        <h2 id="athenaeum"><a href="#athenaeum">The Athenaeum</a></h2>
        <p>
          The Athenaeum is a massive library and vault at the Order’s headquarters that is run and maintained by
          bibliothecary knights. The library houses all manner of historical records: recordings of ancient mythos
          encounters, magical theory and instructions, recordings of daily life of times before the apocalypse, just to
          name a few. The vault houses all manner of bestowed objects, many strange or dangerous and housed within
          confinement specifically tailored to keep each in check. Bibliothecaris are trained in the care and
          preservation of these items, as well as how to deal, to the best of their abilities, with the unexpected that
          comes with bestowed objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bibliothecaris recover items globally, and can be petitioned by communities to establish protected areas of
          local culturally and historically significant areas and landmarks.

        <h2 id="graduation"><a href="#graduation">Graduation</a></h2>
        <p>
          Graduation is a formal tradition derived from centuries past for knight-recruits being elected to knights, and
          knights being elevated to senior knights. These two ceremonies are separate, but both happen twice a month.
          Any recruits or knights ready to graduate when the appropriate time rolls around are gathered in a viewing
          hall to either be knighted with the title of Ser, or given their tokens and linked to their partner. Anyone
          who wishes to view the ceremonies are allowed to do so from surrounding balconies, but are expected to do so
          in silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once knighted or partnered, graduated individuals are sent out to the grounds to serve a night of vigil. Come
          morning, the ceremony is considered complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knights must wear full uniform for graduation.

        <h2 id="raisingday"><a href="#raisingday">Raising Day</a></h2>
        <p>
          A day to remember those lost at the start of the new year. Cairns serve as grave markers in the Order’s
          funerary grounds, and while they can be constructed and maintained all year round, Raising Day is the specific
          observation of remembrance. New cairns are stacked, existing ones are repaired and cleaned, and visitors and
          knights alike may come to leave offerings as they spend the day in observance of those who have rejoined the
          current of magic. In this way, the markers are meant to symbolize this rejoining of the spirit; the stone of
          the earth reaches once more for the expanse of the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not uncommon to also see flowers being released into waterways or floating lanterns being released into
          the sky on Raising Day.

        <h1 id="arthenisle"><a href="#arthenisle">The Isle</a></h1>
        <p>
          The Order has its own island base in the Oceania region, called Arthen Isle. Inaccurately named, Arthen Isle
          is actually a rather large island in its own pocket, and can only be reached through use of Home Gate.
          Civilians looking to reach Arthen must travel through their local outpost, all of which have active gates to
          Arthen Isle. Anyone can leave through Home Gate just as easily, arriving back through to the outpost of their
          choosing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Order’s headquarters are situated in the northeast of the island within a city called Concord. The city
          itself is bright, colorful, and full of waterways, while the Order grounds are expansive. They house gardens,
          churches, dorms, administration, training areas, a courthouse— anything you need, really!
        </p>
        <p>
          Families of knights who call Arthen Isle home also tend to flock to Concord or one of the surrounding towns to
          settle down. There is space for players and moderation alike to shape these additional places as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arthen Isle has never seen tangled magic reach its shores.
        </p>

        <h2 id="homegate"><a href="#homegate">Home Gate</a></h2>
        <p>
          A massive monument of a squared off arch in the heart of the Order’s headquarters. It’s pale color shines in
          the sun, and the inner walls of its arch are covered with tiles of enchanted relief sculptures that gently
          shift to depict scenes precious to those who pass through it, of which hundreds do daily.
        </p>

        <h2 id="funeralbell"><a href="#funeralbell">Funeral Bell</a></h2>
        <p>
          A lonely tower just off the shore of the Order’s headquarters. It houses a bell that rings out a solemn note
          whenever a knight perishes in the line of duty. On Raising Day it rings out once every hour, on the hour, in
          tribute to those fallen.
