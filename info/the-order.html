THE ORDER
Concordia Order is a millennia old, international order of knights whose foundation and practice is rooted in tradition despite the persistence of the order into the modern day. Prior to the manifestation of the plague and the apocalypse of the world, the Order’s primary duty was to defend global order and justice through service to the world’s population. They sought to promote the well-being of all peoples, and maintain international peace and security through widespread cooperation. Such a task was believed to have been the will of the magic that coursed through everyone, and the knights the tools of this will. 

The Order’s emblem. Two halves with an ‘awakened’ light when whole.
Today, this duty and hope for peace persists. The Order acts as something between Interpol and the Jedi (to provide some points of reference). They continue to fight international crime but are meant to be peacekeepers, not soldiers, as they tend to the magical balance of the world and maintain the flow of magic currents in hopes to prevent another apocalyptic event. 
The Order is also responsible for global safety and stasis regarding magical phenomena, primarily in relation to the plague. Knights are the only individuals with magic to cleanse tangled areas and people. For this reason the Order claims the budding return of access to mythos forms must be limited to their own ranks, but because of this tightly kept leash, tensions around and opinions of knights range globally. Still, they are present worldwide for smaller feats too, like dealing with bestowed objects. Due to people not having direct access to magic on an individual level anymore, encounters with enchanted objects can be dangerous because of general ignorance. In these situations, knights also step in. 
Mass recruiting through means of conscription was not uncommon in the Order in the centuries prior to the apocalypse. Now, the order is made up almost entirely of volunteers (many joining due to the desire to gain access to their true selves), though conscription of nonviolent criminals, or destitute individuals sometimes still occurs as a formality to provide these people with means of rehabilitation or livelihood. However, those seeking to volunteer would make their way to the Order’s headquarters, likely by way of a knight-maintained outpost. 
Knight-recruits come to live on the isle that houses said headquarters while they train, with needs like food and housing met. They are trained in combat, philosophy, and magical theory. A recruit will not gain access to a mythos form unless they are deemed worthy of graduating to a full-fledged knight and earning the (rather ceremonial in this age) title of ‘Ser.’
Once graduated, a knight is paid a monthly stipend based on their rank. Knights no longer have to live on the isle, though many do. All active knights live near some manner of Order outpost spread across the world, though the level of upkeep varies. 
Knights who have volunteered can elect to leave the Order at any time, but may not return upon being retired. 

Knight uniforms. Standard knights are not required to wear uniforms at all times, and most often don’t when on assignment that does not involve a necessary level of presentation. Knights are expected to adorn some measure of identifiable apparel when monitoring an outpost, and must be in full uniform for traditional ceremonies or event appearances. Their cloaks are entirely ornamental. Specific tailoring can be adjusted, like the length of sleeves and the type of shirt collar, but colors cannot.
PARTNERS
In order to be assigned a partner, a knight must express interest to higher ups. Consideration will begin for an appropriate assignment and, if found, the pair will be made and begin additional training together. A knight will never choose their own partner, though it is possible for partners to have a preexisting relationship, such as siblings, friends, or romantic partners. It is also just as  possible for partners to have never met and be expected to succeed regardless. There are no standards for the age, gender, or type of mythos that may make up a duo, aside from the fact that partners will always be taught opposing inheritances. Knights will not graduate to senior knights as a fully formed pair until able to fully embrace one of these two schools of magic and thought. 
Only extreme cases will see an established pair reassigned to new partners. A knight may be reassigned if their partner dies, but many who have experienced this particular loss go years without requesting a new partner. 
INHERITANCES
Inheritances are unique magic practices developed by the order for the sole purpose of cleansing tangled magic. Their details are a well-guarded secret, and in order to be promoted to the senior ranking and be assigned a partner, knights must magically swear themselves to said secrecy. 
The two inheritances are the school of Heaven, and the school of Earth, after the two source wells of magic. A knight training to be a senior knight is assigned to the inheritance they will more easily be able to mentally and physically embrace wholeheartedly. Successfully accomplishing cleansing magic is to join your own magic to tangled heaven or earth currents, and unravel it back to your own signature. Because of the threat of losing yourself to the wild magic’s persuasion, a knight’s magic is linked to a partner of the opposing inheritance to either keep them afloat, or keep them grounded. 

The Earth element of the Order’s emblem. It is meant to evoke roots within the earth, and the sweeping tide.

The Heaven element of the Order’s emblem. It is meant to evoke rays from the sun, and the rolling clouds.
TOKENS
A pair of knights are linked together by use of enchanted pieces of jewelry known as tokens. All senior knights and above must wear their tokens while on duty; wearing them otherwise is up to the user. Tokens may be items handcrafted to a recruit’s taste by an Order smith, or belongings handed over to the Order forge upon the start of a knight’s senior training. Tokens must be fairly easy to remove, like a necklace, earring, bracelet, or ring. 
Upon senior promotion, paired knights are granted their near-complete tokens, which are finalized by smiths severing a small piece of a user’s magic and tying it to their partner’s token. This process creates a feed of base level thoughts and emotions between the pair, and allows cleansing magic to be safely performed. In cases of extreme emotion or thought, a knight may be overwhelmed by their partner’s will, but the magic bond is generally viewed as a strength by the Order, allowing a pair to act as an extension of each other when necessary rather than two separate parts. 
Tokens are also enchanted to allow knights to create and pass through gates. 
GATES
A gate is a magical doorway that allows a user to teleport back to a token’s ‘home base’ setting. A knight’s token will either be set to return them to the Home Gate, a monument in the heart of the Order’s headquarters on Arthen Isle, or to the outpost in which they report to on a daily basis. In order to open a gate a knight only has to muster the desire to do so, and then step through any archway or opening that has no interruptions. Knights can send others through the gate before themselves, but the magic will die as soon as the caster passes through.
Home Gate has the unique ability to send those who pass beneath it to any archway or opening in the world, but all other gates return those who pass through to the casting token’s established home base.
Here’s an inspiration board for things that might serve as gates.
OUTPOSTS
Outposts are Order establishments outside of Arthen Isle. They are sites of recovery, hospice, and transport for those who need it, and places where civilians can request the assistance of their local knights. Not every request is honored; knights assist as they see capable without breaking their pledge to be unbiased servants rather than political soldiers. 
The size of outposts and the amount of knights serving them vary based on the size of the community they are hosted in or around. Outposts are often decorated with, or nearby shrines depicting mythos who lived before the apocalypse. In many cases, the identities of these figures are unknown. They could be knights who became legends in the area, members of long-established families, or maybe even holy figures from a time when a pantheon could have been more diverse. 
TAPESTRIES
A fancy word for what is far better described as threads, tapestries are strings imbued with a fragment of a knight’s magic. This fraction is harvested when a knight-recruit graduates. While the strings may look like nothing to the average individual, if correctly prompted, the string can weave itself into a tapestry that depicts the subject’s life in such a way that honors them. There is a hall in which tapestries of the fallen are displayed.
Unknown to all but higher ups in the Order and those tasked to care for the tapestries, the strings can be read through physical touch by those trained to do so. This ability allows the Order to track knight whereabouts through the connection to their personal magic signatures.

RANKS
The following is listed from the lowest ranking knight tier, to the highest ranking knight tier. Any of the following standard knights may also request to be smiths, allowing them the opportunity to learn how to forge tokens. All knights of this division that are senior knight rank or higher have partners.
KNIGHT-RECRUIT
Anyone in the ranks of the Order that has not yet gone through their graduation ceremony and consequently not yet earned the title of 'Ser'. Recruits live at the Order's headquarters on Arthen Isle, following set routines that govern their training. Recruits do not get access to their mythos form.
KNIGHT
Along with senior knights, the rank with the highest numbers. Knights have graduated to earn the title of ‘Ser,’ and are ‘awoken’ to have access to their mythos forms, though they have not been assigned a partner. They vary greatly in age and experience, as some opt never to partner and rank higher. Knights are sent out into the world to fulfill any Order duties unrelated to the plague, which they cannot assist in cleansing without a partner. Often, these duties revolve around public service and maintaining outposts.
SENIOR KNIGHT
Along with knights, the rank with the highest numbers. Senior knights are knights who have been assigned a partner and can now perform cleansing magic on areas and individuals afflicted by wild magic. Senior knights, because of the level of distinction they have earned from their fellow knights, are often entrusted with work of a more dangerous or important nature when necessary.
KNIGHT CONSTABLE
Knights who have earned the right to lead small groups of their fellow knights. They are often under the order of knight commanders, who send them off to oversee missions on a case by case basis. It is not uncommon for them to have a specific territory they are most assigned to.
KNIGHT COMMANDER
A high honor, and generally the highest achievement most knights ever earn. Knight commanders have the authority to oversee small, defined territories throughout the world, sending out small numbers of teams to patrol and act as needed.
HIGH CONSTABLE
Knights serving the first knight much in the same way that knight constables serve commanders. They are often the voices of the first knight throughout the world and the isle, making appearances and speaking on their better’s behalf as needed.
FIRST KNIGHT
The head of the Order. In theory it should be a single pair of knights, but the current First predates the introduction of pairs and has never gone through a pairing ceremony. When deceased or retired however, a pair of high constables will replace her. A First’s duties revolve around overseeing the network of knights in their command, though little is publicly known about the minutiae of inner workings.
SPECIALIZATIONS
The following are subgroups of knights with more tailored duties within the Order, who do not see to the standard duties of other knights. They receive access to mythos forms, and can rise in ranks within their division, but do not receive individual partners and as a result are not taught, nor can they perform, cleansing magic. 

KEEPFLEET
A division of the order responsible for global mail delivery. While communities have their own local postal services, Keepfleet knights deal with global deliveries via outposts, and are especially equipped to deal with the delivery of magical items. Postal knights, affectionately referred to as posties, naturally maintain trade routes and are also commonly requested in service of deliveries that have important political or economical associations. 
Posties are allowed to travel freely through most territories, and can sometimes be seen with standard knights if expected to cross into areas of question or danger.  

Postal knight uniforms. Posties are required to wear their uniforms at all times when on duty as they need to be easily identifiable as they pass through territories, both for their own safety and to make their availability of service known. Their cloaks act largely as protection from inclement weather. Specific tailoring can be adjusted, like the length of sleeves and the type of shirt collar, but colors cannot.
THE ATHENAEUM
The Athenaeum is a massive library and vault at the Order’s headquarters that is run and maintained by bibliothecary knights. The library houses all manner of historical records: recordings of ancient mythos encounters, magical theory and instructions, recordings of daily life of times before the apocalypse, just to name a few. The vault houses all manner of bestowed objects, many strange or dangerous and housed within confinement specifically tailored to keep each in check. Bibliothecaris are trained in the care and preservation of these items, as well as how to deal, to the best of their abilities, with the unexpected that comes with bestowed objects. 
Bibliothecaris recover items globally, and can be petitioned by communities to establish protected areas of local culturally and historically significant areas and landmarks.

Bibliothecary uniforms. Bibliothecaris are required to wear their uniforms when on an assignment that will see them interact with bestowed objects, or artefacts being requisitioned for archival purposes. Their cloaks act largely as aprons. Specific tailoring can be adjusted, like the length of sleeves and the type of shirt collar, but colors cannot.

CEREMONIES & OBSERVATIONS
GRADUATION
Graduation is a formal tradition derived from centuries past for knight-recruits being elected to knights, and knights being elevated to senior knights. These two ceremonies are separate, but both happen twice a month. Any recruits or knights ready to graduate when the appropriate time rolls around are gathered in a viewing hall to either be knighted with the title of Ser, or given their tokens and linked to their partner. Anyone who wishes to view the ceremonies are allowed to do so from surrounding balconies, but are expected to do so in silence. 
Once knighted or partnered, graduated individuals are sent out to the grounds to serve a night of vigil. Come morning, the ceremony is considered complete.
Knights must wear full uniform for graduation. 
RAISING DAY
A day to remember those lost at the start of the new year. Cairns serve as grave markers in the Order’s funerary grounds, and while they can be constructed and maintained all year round, Raising Day is the specific observation of remembrance. New cairns are stacked, existing ones are repaired and cleaned, and visitors and knights alike may come to leave offerings as they spend the day in observance of those who have rejoined the current of magic. In this way, the markers are meant to symbolize this rejoining of the spirit; the stone of the earth reaches once more for the expanse of the sky. 
It is not uncommon to also see flowers being released into waterways or floating lanterns being released into the sky on Raising Day.
THE ISLE
The Order has its own island base in the Oceania region, called Arthen Isle. Inaccurately named, Arthen Isle is actually a rather large island in its own pocket, and can only be reached through use of Home Gate. Civilians looking to reach Arthen must travel through their local outpost, all of which have active gates to Arthen Isle. Anyone can leave through Home Gate just as easily, arriving back through to the outpost of their choosing.  
The Order’s headquarters are situated in the northeast of the island within a city called Concord. The city itself is bright, colorful, and full of waterways, while the Order grounds are expansive. They house gardens, churches, dorms, administration, training areas, a courthouse— anything you need, really!
Families of knights who call Arthen Isle home also tend to flock to Concord or one of the surrounding towns to settle down. There is space for players and moderation alike to shape these additional places as needed.
Arthen Isle has never seen tangled magic reach its shores. 
PLACES OF NOTE
Home Gate
A massive monument of a squared off arch in the heart of the Order’s headquarters. It’s pale color shines in the sun, and the inner walls of its arch are covered with tiles of enchanted relief sculptures that gently shift to depict scenes precious to those who pass through it, of which hundreds do daily.
Funeral Bell
A lonely tower just off the shore of the Order’s headquarters. It houses a bell that rings out a solemn note whenever a knight perishes in the line of duty. On Raising Day it rings out once every hour, on the hour, in tribute to those fallen. 
Here is a pinboard of Order grounds inspiration!
