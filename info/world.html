        <h1 id="world"><a href="#world">World</a></h1>

        <p>
          The world of Concordia Order is an <strong>alternate reality of our own</strong> in which <strong>magic
            exists</strong> and always has existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continents, countries, and their borders are <strong>largely the same</strong>.
          Unique spaces like cities and territories can be made within them, and you can design communities
          and how they operate related to your OCs. Smaller land masses like islands may also be fabricated for this
          setting. Culture can be referenced from our own, and is encouraged within canon compliancy, but aspects like
          our real-world governments and politics should be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Non-sapient wildlife</strong> within the world may be fantastical and there is freedom to dictate
          what exists where. Fantastical wildlife will be <strong>natural parts</strong> of an ecosystem with a few
            extra quirks here or there. None of these beasts are immortal, were once human, have extreme magical abilities, or
          anything else our mythology might suggest. The size and vibe of the wildlife should mirror what may be found in the area
            naturally. An elephant sized drake will not be wandering around a North American meadow, but you
          might catch sight of a salamander sized one. A phoenix isn’t going to be flying around the arctic, but you
          might find one in warmer areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aesthetics and sensibilities of the world mix <strong>solarpunk</strong> inspiration with <strong>early
            1900s</strong> aspects. Magic, for a long time, made the rapid progression of technology somewhat
          unnecessary. Airships and flip phones may exist now, but cars are old-fashioned and most people move around by
          train. There is a focus on <strong>communal assets</strong> and <strong>environmental sustainability</strong> in the world.
          Even the most urban cities have a widespread <strong>presence of nature</strong> and more <strong>archaic
            landmarks</strong> paying tribute to the magic of the world. Although culture of course varies from location
          to location, the introduction of the organic, in terms of shape and flow, is common in architecture and
          technology globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some examples of the design sense of the world include, but are not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The abstraction and organic flow of the <strong>Jugendstil</strong> or <strong>Art Nouveau</strong>
            movements.</li>
          <li>The natural inspiration and prominent detail and colors in <strong>Islamic</strong> architecture.</li>
          <li>The combination of different cultural influences, like <strong>Japanese-Western Eclectic</strong>
            architecture or <strong>Indo-Saracenic</strong> architecture.</li>
          <li>This is, as an example, not limited to British influence outside of the UK in this RP setting. Global
            influence is mutually common; you are just as likely to see a large swath of Japanese influenced
            architecture in England, or Indian influenced architecture in France, as you would be the reverse.</li>
          <li>The use of ancient design structures and sensibilities as seen in <strong>Neoclassicism</strong> or
            <strong>Egyptian Revival</strong> movements.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Despite all that, Concordia Order is considered set in a <strong>post-apocalypse</strong>, of a sort. The
          world has largely lost its connection to magic on an individual level, and much ancient history has been lost
          globally as a result. Things that once may have existed as fact are now beliefs held only by some.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strength of acceptance in the following varies: the <strong>planet itself is a mythos</strong>, and its
          <strong>death was the apocalypse</strong>. What is known, as a fact, is that every living human was previously
          born with access to a mythical creature form, often referred to as their <strong>true self</strong>. The
          ability to shift between a mythos form and a human form was innate for all, but said ability has since been
          <strong>lost as a natural instinct</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Established mythology suggests that the existence of this aspect of human nature was from a symbiosis or
          connection to the planet itself. <strong>Magic is consciousness</strong>, and everyone is born of the same
          consciousness, sharing some great and grand dream, only to return in death to the shared pool of consciousness
          once more. Magic doesn’t just flow through us, it is us, and for a time we could find each new shape of that
          magic in ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific nature of the apocalypse is unknown, details having been lost to time, but various pieces of
          documentation record the start of a <strong>magical plague</strong> occurring before the cataclysmic event,
          and said plague being the <strong>source of the severing between humanity and their natural magic</strong>.
          This affliction upon the world is a <strong>fatal one</strong>. It is magic, pure and unfiltered, gone
          rampant.
        </p>
        <p>
          While humanity’s relationship with the natural current of magic is most often instinctively processed and
          shaped to their own unique signature, in the <strong>case of the sickness, it is the wild magic whose state
            wins out in the end</strong>. It unravels an individual’s natural signature to match that of its own,
          <strong>leaving those it ‘corrupts’ stuck in an almost bestial state of rampaging pain</strong> as a result.
          <strong>Knights of the Order can reverse the process, but only enough to put afflicted individuals to
            rest</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source of this affliction is unknown, but theories suggest it was a <strong>corruption of the minds and
            hearts of humanity that polluted the well</strong> from which all mythos life springs, or fed something
          lurking there since the dawn of balance itself. Violence against one another, all pieces of the same whole,
          grew to such a degree that the planet, the source of all life, developed a manner in which to rid itself of
          this pain, <strong>like a body attacking a virus</strong>. Humanity’s magic fought back, and a <strong>great
            severing occurred</strong>, killing the planet mythos, <strong>Leyk</strong>, in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supposedly the climax of this apocalyptic event quelled the plague for a time, but <strong>only far enough
            for the wild magic to lay near-dormant in less trodden corners of the world</strong>. The ailment has since
          begun to grow in reach once more, making <strong>patches of the globe dangerous to traverse even for
            knights</strong>. Affected areas appear at best as gloomy, overcast environments, and at worst as miasma
          swarmed, decaying scenery. Local wildlife is often frenzied, if at all present. These areas are extremely
          dangerous and <strong>advised to be avoided at all costs</strong>, but some individuals go out of their way to
          seek them out, claiming the early touches of the plague offer connection back to the source of all magic that
          bestows them with visions and powers in times of need. Most of these people are not heard from again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever exactly it is that happened, it’s viewed as a <strong>collectively shared trauma</strong> for all of
          humanity. For life to prosper freely once more, it is thought that the <strong>waste and the sickness must be
            carved away. Knights of Concordia Order bear the unique responsibility of being able to do so</strong>, and
          serve the plaet almost in penance for a way they once failed— but perhaps each of us must too cut away the
          worst parts of ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story within Concordia Order as a setting largely follows the efforts to <strong>heal the growing
            sickness</strong>, the conflicting efforts many groups of people are making to <strong>reopen the connection
            to magic</strong>, and all the unsteadiness that comes with a <strong>world at odds with itself</strong> and
          rapidly changing around you.

        <h2 id="concordia-order"><a href="#concordia-order">CONCORDIA ORDER</a></h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>millennia old, international organization</strong> whose origins were founded around maintaining a
          global effort of balance. Their form has changed over the years; they have grown in numbers, reputation, and
          skill, but their goal still remains the same: <strong>Preserve the well-being of mythos and maintain the
            equilibrium of magic</strong>. Members are called <strong>knights</strong>. Their central hub is on a large
          isle in the Oceania region called <strong>Arthen Isle</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Order has its own, more exhaustive, <a href="/concordia-order/info/the-order">page here</a>!
        </p>
        <h2 id="lost-guard"><a href="#lost-guard">THE LOST GUARD</a></h2>
        <p>
          Public accounts of the nature of the Lost Guard vary greatly. All reports do seem to suggest that <strong>the
            Guard exists in some manner of conflict with the Order</strong>, stepping in where the latter fails, but the
          amount of vitriol from appearance to appearance varies. Some sightings of those who claim themselves members
          seem to be well-meaning vigilantes, while other moments are tense encounters with those who cause terror and
          unrest. The truth of the matter is this: <strong>many people have adopted the title of the Guard, alongside
            its imagery, for their own self-interest</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is not publicly known fact in-character, but the <strong>true Lost Guard was indeed started by
            an individual rejected from senior knighthood in the Order</strong>, who seeks to step in where the
          traditional, and often neutral, <strong>methods of the Order fail</strong>. It is sort of a wayward home for
          those who seek to do better, and mean well, though the Guard is not without its only flaws-- particularly in
          regard to how its small, secretive nature has led to others with more nefarious intentions adopting its name
          and imagery.
        </p>
        <strong>The Guard’s genuine numbers are little, and they act to the best of their ability in secrecy</strong>,
        as the Order seeks their arrests. They have a hidden island base called <strong>Moornesse</strong> somewhere in
        the Celtic Sea, that only they know the exact means to get to.

        <h2 id="salus-animarum"><a href="#salus-animarum">SALUS ANIMARUM</a></h2>
        <p>
          Colloquially referred to as the Parliament, the Salus Animarum is a <strong>council of figureheads
            representing communities worldwide</strong> with at least one unified goal: <strong>keep the Order in
            check</strong>. Any community can petition for a seat at Parliament, but those hoping to be elected to its
          ranks often need some measure of political, economic, or religious influence to be voted in by existing
          members. It is very much a <strong>gathering of elites</strong>, and the <strong>only group aside from the
            order</strong> who has <strong>legal access</strong> in some small part <strong>to mythos forms</strong>.
        </p>
        The group is headed by an even more specific council within the Parliament’s ranks. <strong>Equally in charge
          over all else are four <em>cardinals</em></strong>, each named for a cardinal direction. Beneath them are
        <strong>another four <em>intercardinals</em></strong> who serve in partnership as an advisor to one of the
        primary cardinals. <strong>This group of eight is called the <em>principal council</em></strong>.
        <strong>There are another eight <em>half-winds</em></strong> beneath them to provide further elevated input.
        <strong>All other members are called <em>quarter-winds</em></strong>.
        In rare cases, an elected official may resign from Parliament. In most cases, <strong>only death removes them
          from their positions</strong>. Any absence of a half-wind or above is filled within a week by a
        full-parliament vote.
        The Salus Animarum came into being as a power of balance against the Order when people started to question and
        protest the latter’s reach. Whatever the intentions, Parliament has largely grown into its own, and has
        <strong>influence in governments across the globe</strong>, for better or for worse.
        <strong>Cardinals, intercardinals, and half-winds are all granted access to their mythos forms through
          collaboration with the Order</strong>, as part of the agreement between the two organizations to not have what
        may come across as totalitarian control. Spots among these ranks are highly sought after as a result.
        Parliament is housed within <stong>its own small region</stong> between <strong>Marseille and St. Tropez in the
          south of France</strong>. While the sixteen cardinals may in part have residences elsewhere, <strong>they are
          expected to live part time at the Salus Animarum’s grounds, and be available for council at a moment’s
          notice</strong>.

        <h2 id="gloriola-foundation"><a href="#gloriola-foundation">GLORIOLA FOUNDATION</a></h2>
        <p>
          A well-known <strong>charitable foundation</strong> with somewhat of a global reach. Gloriola seeks to
          <strong>provide welfare and resources</strong> such as medical attention to <strong>people down on their
            luck</strong> around the world. What started as an organization funded by a few incredibly wealthy
          individuals has grown to an <strong>abundantly public-funded</strong> outreach network with <strong>large
            institutions in major metropolitan areas</strong> worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2 id="l-enochet-universite"><a href="#l-enochet-universite">L’ÉNOCHET UNIVERSITÉ</a></h2>
        <p>
          <strong>A world-renowned university, directly sponsored by the Salus Animarum</strong>. Situated in the
          <strong>heart of Paris</strong>, the Énochet is one of the oldest universities still in operation in the world
          of Concordia Order. It is considered a hub of creativity and progress; acceptance into the university is
          highly competitive and highly sought after. It has departments supporting<strong> arts and humanities, science
            and engineering, health sciences, and social sciences</strong>. Many achievements of the modern world, both
          mundane and magical, have ties to Énochet alumni.
        </p>
        <p>
          While usually in the news for yet another mark of success, the university has recently come under some fire
          when headlines broke about a <strong>member of faculty</strong>, also a recent postgraduate student,
          <strong>conducting illegal research into accessing mythos forms</strong>. Said individual has since been
          turned over to the Order, but questions remain about the scope of the study and others’ places within it.
          Members of Parliament have denied any connection to the research and disavowed the efforts.
        </p>

              and academic faires. Most students of the modern day wear street clothes when attending class but
              incorporate their kerchiefs into their apparel nonetheless, as being admitted to Énochet is a feat viewed
              as worthy of pride or a bit of showing off.</em></figcaption>

        <h1 id="religion"><a href="#religion">RELIGION</a></h1>
        <p>
          The following is by no means an exhaustive list, rather some well-known structures of theological doctrine
          globally. There is room both within them, and outside of them, to shape unique aspects of faith your
          characters may or may not hold, should you so desire.
        </p>

        <h2 id="leykism"><a href="#leykism">LEYKISM</a></h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Leykism</strong> is the belief in the <strong>planetary mythos</strong>, sometimes referred to with the name Leyk, as
          the <strong>source or creator of all life and magic</strong>, and consequently worthy of some measure of reverence because of
          it. Leykism is a <strong>common faith across the globe</strong>, though the specific scope and shape of that belief varies
          greatly depending on where you are in the world, or who specifically you’re speaking to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observations of the faith generally stress a <strong>respect for the natural world</strong> and a <strong>connection between all life</strong>,
          whether or not people actually honor either. Followers seek guidance from Leyk’s memory all the same.
          <strong>Interpretations of the planetary mythos’ true form varies greatly</strong> from community to community with people
          often depicting it as they would see themselves, or as the mythos forms they believe themselves derived from.
          So too does idolatry change from place to place. There remains a <strong>shared aspect in interpretations of Leyk
          being a whole and the people upon it fragments</strong>, but imagery varies. Some see Leyk as a garden, and themselves
          flowers, others snowflakes in a storm. Some interpretations depict Leyk through a collection of fragmented
          colored glass while others see it as light made up of many rays. Possibilities go on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some find <strong>room for all interpretations of Leyk</strong>, believing it able to take any form, while others feel
          depictions of the pieces or whole of Leyk that do not match their own interpretations <strong>desecrate the memory</strong> of
          this shared creator.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heralds-of-ethernity"><a href="#heralds-of-ethernity">HERALDS OF ETHERNITY</a></h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps originally a divergence from Leykism, those who consider themselves heralds <strong>seek spiritual guidance
          and truth among the heavens</strong>. They hunt knowledge about the universe’s mysteries among the stars and interpret
          the voices of the wind. They are <strong>future minded</strong>, and believe in the <strong>return of some sort of healing savior from
          the skies above</strong>. In order to open a door for such a return, many believe they must embrace their
          interpretation of the heavens so wholly (be that being lofty, detached, free-spirited-- whatever they so deem)
          that they can <strong>shape the sky in turn</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="loamsteppen-communion"><a href="#loamsteppen-communion">LOAMSTEPPEN COMMUNION</a></h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps originally a divergence from Leykism, those who follow the Communion entrust their steps to the
          history of stone and <strong>seek fulfillment from symbiosis with the earth</strong>. They believe blessings and redemption are
          earned by toil of and reverence for the dirt and water beneath their feet. They are <strong>past minded</strong>, though many
          new practitioners <strong>seek a sense of spiritual rebirth</strong> while still acknowledging what mistakes or failings may
          have led them to their current place in life. Some believe that by embracing their interpretation of the earth
          wholeheartedly (be that being resolute, headstrong, patient-- whatever they so deem) they <strong>open themselves up
          to endless ripe blessings</strong>, easily plucked, that others cannot see.
        </p>

        <h2 id="reverie-path"><a href="#reverie-path">THE REVERIE PATH</a></h2>

          Little is publicly known about the inner workings of the Path for those who do not follow it. Practitioners
          are often private, as <strong>common publicly held beliefs are that the followers of the Path are dangerous or mad</strong>.
          These opinions come from the proclivity of members of the Path to intentionally <strong>seek out plagued areas of the
          world in search of salvation</strong>. In this way, many observers of the Path may be <strong>desperate</strong> people more than
          anything else, looking for hope when all other options have been exhausted. Those deeply down on their luck
          are enticed by claims of mind-bending phenomena that exist only along the fringes of plagued areas, <strong>offering
          visions that may hold deeper answers to one’s specific journey, or the universe’s</strong>. Despite no academic
          recordings of such, people of the Path pursue this magic all the same, with scripture within their own
          teachings suggesting <strong>these pilgrimages are the only way to reconnect with the lost dream all life once shared,
          a paradise just out of reach.</strong>

        <p>
          The Dandelions are more a <strong>children’s bedtime story</strong> about a practice of thought rather than a modernly
          practiced religion— supposedly. In order to get children to behave, parents sing songs and spin tales of a
          <strong>jolly band of do-gooders</strong> that seek to spread warmth and kindness wherever they go, spreading that simple
          ideology where they tread, <strong>leaving the ‘seeds’ of their actions behind</strong>. Thus one good deed prompts another and
          so on, until the world is a better place than it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dandelion imagery comes from the <strong>sentiment of wishing</strong>, and the <strong>rapid spread of weed growth</strong>. The silly
          stories and songs have remained in a cultural zeitgeist as a tool to promote good behavior in children, but
          the original source of the idea of the Dandelions is unknown and long-contested. Perhaps it really was a path
          to follow, once upon a time.
