        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>
          This should all generally be self-evident, but we can run through the usual just to make sure we are all on
          the same page! If you fail to hold yourself to this standard of conduct, moderation reserves the right to
          remove you from any and all spaces related to Concordia Order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, this is primarily my (elfie!) little brain baby. ;v; Please be nice and don’t take the touys. Your
          characters and what you do with them are, of course, yours! But please do not use components external to that
          elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now for the rules!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> First and foremost, <strong>be kind</strong>! Both to yourself, and the people around you. <strong>Do not
              blame others’ out-of-character for in-character interactions, or use in-character interactions to vent
              out-of-character feelings.</strong> There are some things to be taken seriously and some things to not get
            hung up on. This is an RP! We are here to have fun, and it should be fun. Being passionate and excited for
            your character is welcome, but making mountains out of molehills for things best solved by a brief step away
            from the computer will not be indulged.
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Communicate!</strong> Talk to moderation and your RP partners if you are feeling strange about
            anything. If you have ideas for mini campaigns, please feel welcome speaking up to moderation when the
            appropriate venues are open! Please, however, continue to be mindful and appropriate about your
            communication, and recognize when you need to tend kindly to yourself with a step away above all else.
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Do not guilt trip, subtalk, or overshare to your fellow members.</strong> This includes in the
            <strong>discord server</strong>, but also on <strong>any other public forum where they could see</strong>.
            Simply put, it’s not nice and this is meant to be for fun! We’re all adults here.
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Do not powerplay or metagame.</strong> When developing a character’s individual magic, keep in
            mind balance and restrictions. Also, there may be things you the player know or discover that your character
            would not know. There may be secrets you learn about other characters that you should ask about before
            sharing. Be mindful!
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Do not attention grab.</strong> This is not sharing your work or making reference to your
            characters, but constantly and abruptly changing conversion to be about yourself and your characters without
            meaningfully engaging with other people’s content. Allow breathing room! <strong>Give the attention to
              others that you would like to receive in turn.</strong>
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Please keep all NSFW content to private spaces.</strong> Do not share NSFW artwork or roleplay
            NSFW in the server. Light jokes are fine, but please avoid explicit topics. <strong>Do not pressure others
              into ERP.</strong>
          </li>
          <li> <strong>Respect that moderation has the final say.</strong> There may be instances where moderation has
            to problem-solve conflict. There may be other situations where moderation is particular about adhering to
            the set canon, and what fits within those guidelines. Please understand that we are trying our best! We are
            also here to chill and have fun. Be patient, and recognize that ultimately we will have the final say in
            these scenarios.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Again, moderation <strong>reserves the right to remove anyone who cannot comply with these expectations of
            conduct.</strong>
          Warnings will be issued as needed, but better just to not get to that point at all if we can help it. We’re
          all adults here for a good time, yeah? Let’s play nice!
        </p>
