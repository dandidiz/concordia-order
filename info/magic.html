MAGIC
Magic is everything in the world of Concordia Order in that it exists within everything, and to be alive is to hold magic within yourself. Although not generally visible to the naked eye, magic is described as currents of energy, moving as freely and as presently throughout the world as oxygen might. This flow is thought to exist as a grand circle.
Raw, natural magic of the world is often referred to as wild magic. It is thought to have two ‘resting’ points of the highest concentration, known as wells. Observed phenomena suggest their existence, but these wells have, on record, never been accessed by anyone in history; they seem to manifest within their own ‘plane’ of existence. These planes are sometimes referred to as pockets. This wild magic, when unshaped to individual life, is thought to exist in either one of two persuasions depending on which source well it emerges from. There is the Well of Heaven, and the Well of Earth. The Well of Heaven’s specific pocket is sometimes referred to as the Above, while the Well of Earth’s specific pocket is sometimes referred to as the Below. Despite the loss of a direct bridge to these wells, wild magic is attracted in particular to human life all the same, as if drawn to consciousness. 
Pockets of magic can exist to smaller, readily discoverable degrees. Enter a peculiar door, step into a specific ring of mushrooms, or get lost in just the right way, and you might just find yourself in your very own secret hideaway. Entrances to pockets are endlessly varied.    
Despite a lack of recorded evidence to suggest so, many believe the wells and their pockets were previously accessible and the apocalypse in some way severed connection to them, thus resulting in the loss of the natural process of awakening of mythos forms for all. Some hold fast to the belief that they can be reached once more through a return to the collective dream all life on the planet supposedly shares.  
When a piece of that wild magic finds home in the heart of a newborn life, it is thought to take on an additional persuasion. While wild magic manifests naturally as the wells of heaven and earth, in people it is shaped as the bone, the blood, or the flesh. An individual's magic is often referred to as having been ‘bestowed’ upon them. These classifications are more for flavor than anything else; awakened mythos often speak on their presumed classification as one might their astrological sign or personality quiz results. Those of the same persuasion may find similarities in their mythos forms or abilities.  
Objects, in a lesser sense, can also be bestowed magic, though there are no specific persuasions regarding bestowed objects. These items have, through an uncommon fluke, ‘snared’ a magic current enough for power to pool in it, taking on some unique enchantment, curse, or quirk of that nature. The objects are in no way sentient, rather, they have a passive effect, or their magic must be triggered by a living user. It is rare in the post-apocalyptic state of the world for new bestowed objects to manifest; most are relics from the time before. 

MYTHOS’ MAGIC PERSUASIONS
The three alignments for a mythos’ personal magic to be attributed with are bone, blood, and flesh. The imagery is derived from the notion that a person’s magic comes from a part of the planetary mythos, and  each of these parts has aspects to them that are modernly viewed as something between an astrological sign and a personality test like Myers Briggs.
The three alignments are the furthest point on the triangle scale of magic persuasions; a mythos’ personal signature can be anywhere along the lines and within the triangle. It is a sliding scale.

The associated attributes of the alignments are as follows:
Blood-aligned mythos are associated with the thought of the mind. They are said to have powers that strengthen as they persist, giving way to focused momentum. They find drive in consistency, and are often associated with psychic abilities. 
Need help picking a mythos form? Some commonly blood-aligned mythos types are chimeras and mares.
Bone-aligned mythos are associated with the instinct of the gut. They are said to have powers that strengthen as they coalesce, giving way to new beginnings. They find drive in possibility, and are often associated with the elements of earth and water.
Need help picking a mythos form? Some commonly bone-aligned mythos types are gargoyles and hippocampi.
Flesh-aligned mythos are associated with the emotion of the heart. They are said to have powers that strengthen as they expand, giving way to diverse change. They find drive in adaptation, and are often associated with the elements of fire and air.
Need help picking a mythos form? Some commonly flesh-aligned mythos types are dragons and griffins.
While some classic examples of each alignment were provided, these magic assignments are not end-all be-all. Do you think your specific dragon is a little more bone aligned than flesh aligned? That’s entirely valid. An argument can be made for just about every mythos and magic persuasion combo. 
DREAMING
All individuals have the capacity to dream in their mythos body, even when unawakened. If anything, this phenomenon is more widely observed in the unawakened. In sleep you may see through the eyes of a beast you don’t entirely know, stretch limbs you do not find when you wake, and sense the world in a way that feels impossible to replicate when not deep in slumber. 
It is not uncommon for people to try to chase these visions and lucid dream within them to have the full scope of their true self revealed, though this is a difficult task to accomplish. In the most extreme cases, people lose themselves to chasing a constant sleep in hopes to unlock the lost ability to shift.
WISHING
In the modern day, wishing magic is a concept most known as nothing more than a story, but it is a real kind of magic accessible to any individual, awakened or not. However, with knowledge of it largely lost and its necessary trigger being some level of awareness, it is an extremely rare phenomena. Most do not know it is a possible feat; knowledge of such is highly guarded by high-ranking Order knights, and Parliament elite.
The gist of it is this: all magic remains nebulous until it is willed. A heaven or earth influence, and a mythos’ personal affinity are all still considered unwilled states in the natural current of magic. Wishing magic is taking that energy and willing it into a specifically desired state to perform often miraculous seeming feats. 
However, wishing requires a process of equivalent exchange. As an example, an attempt to heal someone with a wish would require someone to give up an amount of energy, their own personal magic, equal to that of what needs to be restored. 
Once an amount of magic is willed, its state remains permanent. That specific piece of magic can never be willed again. It has already been used and lost all potential its nebulous quality had. 
In order to ‘make a wish,’ an individual would have to be aware of their own magical signature and the signature of that which they are trying to affect, which is not a talent many are attuned to in this day and age. 
A wish is almost always granted by a sacrifice of your own energy; it is dangerous to do repeatedly, or to seek to accomplish a grand task as either of these feats could prove fatal for the person wishing. While theoretically possible to draw on energy external to oneself, this is not a feat that should be considered currently possible to the average human or mythos.
THE PLAGUE AND ITS EFFECTS
As previously stated in the World tab, the plague was recorded prior to whatever apocalyptic event struck the planet or even in some way a great part of that event, but its exact origins are now lost to time. When the natural flow of magic becomes too great and too influential it is considered ‘sick’ or ‘tangled’, and it affects the life it comes into contact with by forcing their magical signature to match its own. 
Becoming tangled yourself is currently a fatal affliction. It floods an individual with an immense amount of physical pain, and the turmoil of their sense of self becoming unwound. An ‘tangled’ individual can persist, almost mindlessly, for quite a time, lashing out what comes into contact with them, but the toll of the tangled magic always sees those afflicted perishing eventually. 
Knights of the Order can reverse the tangle through a taught magical practice known as ‘cleansing’, but the reversal is not enough to save those who have been touched by the plague. The wild magic is guided away from the afflicted’s own magic in a risky, delicate process, but what remains is too torn to persist. Cleansing offers those affected their mind returned to them, and a more peaceful passing, but little more. It is still viewed as a highly necessary tool to stop the spread of tangled magic, as it is the only way to undo tangles.
It is possible to tell what persuasion of wild magic has afflicted an individual by the way in which their own magic slowly unravels. Those affected by magic sourced from the Well of Earth will eventually crumble away to dust, and are referred to as stained. Those affected by magic sourced from the Well of Heaven will eventually whistle away to wind, and are referred to as seared.
CLEANSING MAGIC
Cleansing magic is the process of unraveling tangled magic. Only senior knights and ranks above, knights of the Order with partners, are taught this highly guarded technique. The practice is kept hidden under lock and key, and those with its knowledge are sworn to secrecy because of the dangerous nature of the process.
Cleansing magic was researched and designed out of necessity by magical theorists within the Order in a time after the cataclysmic event of the world. In order to accomplish the magic, an individual has to enter a mindset almost completely in-tune with that of either the heaven or earth affinities, temporarily entangle themself within it, and then forcibly guide the wild magic to their own signature rather than vice versa.
Initially, there were no knight pairs involved with this process. All knights were taught cleansing magic, attributed to one of the two persuasions, and worked together to cleanse areas and people affected by the plague. This worked well for a time but, unknown to those suffering, the knights’ own magic was weakening due to repeated exposure to being tangled. In an unexpected tragedy of not too far off history, a large swath of knights sent out to deal with a particularly large pocket of infected land all perished in rapid fashion, crumbling to the earth or whistling away to the heavens. The mass death event was a harrowing mark on the Order and still remembered to this day. 
Cleansing tasks were put on hold in the following months so additional research could be done. The Order eventually stumbled into the hypothesis of partnered knight pairs who were provided enchanted tokens to link their magical signatures together, in order to negate the effect of the wild magic. Each member of the pair would be attuned to a different persuasion of wild magic than their partner. The tie to the heaven-aligned keep the earth-aligned’s magic afloat, and the tie to the earth-aligned keep the heaven-aligned’s magic grounded. This solution has proved effective, and no knight deaths have occurred as a result of cleansing magic since.
MYTHOS
Mythos is the generalized term for all sentient, magical creature forms of humans. Individual forms may be referred to more specifically in terms like a dragon, a unicorn, a griffon, etc, but all can be referred to as a mythos as well. 
For the purposes of Concordia Order, all mythos forms must have some manner of real-world mythological creature inspiration, but the freedom you have to expand upon it is relatively large. 
Once awakened, individuals can switch freely between their human and mythos forms at will. The change is painless when naturally prompted, and human forms will return to the outfit they were wearing when they previously shifted. 
It is common, but not the end-all rule, for members of the same family to be the same type of mythos when awakened. Whether this is a hereditary feat, or a self-fulfilling projection remains to be seen.
Awakening a mythos form may extend a human’s lifespan, generally by no more than a few decades. An awakened individual tends to age more slowly than an unawakened one, but the new vitality is not so much as to make an individual immortal.
APPROPRIATE INSPIRATIONS
All mythos should have the general feeling of slotting biologically into the setting. Magic is energy and a part of the natural state of this world, not something surreal or manufactured. Mythical creatures of legend, cryptics, and medieval bestiary entries are, in general, good points of inspiration for a mythos form. Something like a creepypasta or a copyrighted species from popular media is not, with the only exception for the latter being creatures that have a more generic, long-established equivalent in TTRPG. For example, J.R.R. Tolkein’s ents would technically not be allowed, but a treant would.
No mythos form is ever guaranteed to be the only of its type. You may take inspiration from the Loch Ness monster to make some sort of sea monster mythos, but other people are free to use that point of inspiration as well.
Deities and legendary humans are not appropriate inspirations for this setting. Individual humanoid or beast figures are acceptable if, again, they have devolved into fantasy staples in TTRPGs and the like. While you wouldn’t have the Lamia or the Minotaur, a lamia or a minotaur is an acceptable inspiration for a mythos form.
Moderation reserves the right to ask for changes as needed in order to have a mythos form slot respectfully into the intention and flavor of the world. 
MAKING A MYTHOS AND ITS POWERS
In this setting, your awakened characters can have up to five abilities related to their mythos form! Think of these like Pokemon moves. You might not have access to all of them at the start, but their nature will not change once an application has been approved. Depending on the ability, an individual’s human form may have access to these feats as well, or be affected by passive awakened traits. These abilities can grant a person access to unusual powers standard with magical fair, like turning invisible or having control of an element, but they do not have to be high concept or elaborate magic, in some cases instead relating to the mythos’ physical makeup, like having advanced endurance or a keener sense of smell.
These abilities should not allow you to godmod, or powerplay. Think again in terms of Pokemon moves, or even class abilities in a TTRPG. Member characters are not legendary Pokemon tier, nor are they deities of this world. 
LIMITATIONS
Please note that these limitations exist for all member player characters, but there remains the chance for any of the following to crop up in NPCs to facilitate plot events. This is not guaranteed, but the possibility is being shared so as to not blindside players in a way that makes them feel cheated. Moderation PCs will have the same limitations as member PCs.
No creature is immortal. They should not have powers around immortality or true rebirth.


The dead cannot be revived from a mythos’ powers. There is space for the dead potentially to be revived by wish magic, but this would cost the user their own life. 
Powers can animate a corpse as one might an automaton or puppet.


No time travel related powers.


No creature can transform another to its own shape-- think vampires and werewolves. Both are welcome inspirations, but they would not be creatures that can infect others in this setting. 
Vampires instead might have a humanoid or creaturesque mythos form related to an animal often associated with vampires (bat, cat, rat, as some examples), and have powers related to blood, night, or mental influence.  
Werewolves would be canines of some sort, and might have powers related to the moon, enhanced canine abilities, and physical strength.


While powers related to minor mental suggestion or influence are allowed, the success of these sorts of things must be settled upon between muns, via discussion, dice rolls, or however you see fit to accommodate both parties' comfort levels. Powers that flat out take over another player’s autonomy are not allowed. 


Mythos forms have a size limit and size minimum. While you can be something like a leviathan or a behemoth, the max possible size your mythos form can have is that of a blue whale. If you want to go in the small direction, your character’s mythos form must still be visible to the naked eye.
CREATIVE LIBERTIES: FORMS & ABILITIES
Concordia Order requires an inspiration point from our real-world mythology for mythos forms so that there is a cohesion between the cast of characters and the vibe of the setting we wish to establish. It is also required as it is a general thematic inspiration point for the setting itself, the stories we come from, the truth or lack thereof in them, and the play between what we retain and lose over time, and the stories that grow anew from that experience. 
That said, there is tons of room for creativity off of your ‘root’ inspiration. 
Take two rather common mythos forms, for example, the dragon and the gargoyle. Dragons of real-world eastern and western mythology don’t look the same, but often share a few features, like being reptilian and capable of flight, with or without wings. Dragons in CO would likely be the same: linked in some way to flight, have at least minor reptilian features, more often than not have breath weapons of some sort. However, any other animal influences are welcome to be included, and still have that mythos form be a ‘dragon.’ Here’s a dragon example with sheep/goat inspiration also included.
Likewise, there are tons of examples of different animalistic gargoyles to pull inspiration from to make a living, breathing one as a mythos form in this setting. It’d be common for various gargoyles to have abilities around similar imagery, like stone/earth or water, but maybe you choose to play with abilities related to perception or healing, given a real-world gargoyle’s outward, observant positioning, use in protecting buildings from damage, or association with churches. 
This might all sound a bit rigid or intimidating, but even looser interpretations of a mythos can be pitched so long as you’re keeping to the ‘vibe’ for lack of a better word. Intention goes a long way! An example would be the following: I want to make an OC inspired by a chalkydri, which are fantastical creatures described as angelic serpents with a crocodile’s head and limbs, a lion’s tail, and multiple sets of wings, all shining with the colors of a rainbow. I decide I want to nix the limbs altogether for the OC to be a true serpent, and replace the tuft of fur on the end of its tail with more feathers instead. I keep the reptilian vibe and the rainbow appearance. This keeps the ‘vibe’ and would be allowed, even alongside someone else coming along and making a chalkydri more in line with the original description, or another person making their own chalkydri that introduces additional feline traits into the mix. 
Creating abilities for your mythos allows for the same freedom. These powers should be convincingly related to your mythos form via aspects like associated animals, elements, and mythology, but how far you want to, or can, stretch that is largely up to your efforts to reasonably connect the dots. 
Abilities should also have balance in the sense that they feel achievable for an individual to perform at a regular occurrence. A mythos might have one or two of their five abilities that are a bit more grandiose than the average fare, but these would be skills that demand a great amount of time or energy from them.
Here are a few examples of some mythos forms and abilities, with their reasonings for them in hopes it helps illuminate how you can craft your own mythos forms. Note, I enjoy giving abilities silly or thematic names, but this is not required if all you wish to do is describe its effect.
EXAMPLE ONE - DRAGON
Let’s work with that same dragon again. The character in question is Irish, and I wanted an animal associated with Ireland involved in his mythos form, thus the sheep influence. As far as abilities go, a starting point could be picking an associated element for a breath weapon, and then drawing inspiration from dragons in fairytales. In this OC’s case, I chose combustion as a sort of breath weapon, to relate to the character’s somewhat explosive personality. Here’s what his five abilities could be:
SPARKING AT THE SEAMS
Skender has a breath weapon of sparking combustion. It seems to be some mix of fire and electricity that bursts like a firework upon impact.
Dragon’s commonly have breath weapons. As stated above, this one was inspired by the character’s overall personality.
SCALEY HIDE
Even while in human form it is difficult to break Skender’s skin. He can still bruise and be cut, but it takes a lot of effort to accomplish the latter.
This ability is pretty self-explanatory! Skender has scales, so I made him a bit sturdier.
A DRAGON’S HOARD
Skender can sniff out and track precious metals.
Here’s an example of pulling from stories about, or imagery around an inspiration. Dragons are often depicted with hoards of wealth, especially gold, and I wanted to give Skender something silly related to that.
FURY OF THE NIGHT
Skender flies faster under cover of night.
There isn’t a particular image or story to justify this power, but it’s rather unobtrusive in its scale and relates to Skender’s anatomy in that he has wings. Because it’s not a grandiose stretch to achieve some spectacular feat, this would be fine.
BILLY GOAT GRUFF
Skender’s horns emit a stunning effect upon direct impact with them. The duration and intensity of the effect varies on the size of the creature being rammed.
A combination of a few aspects: Skender’s anatomy, his breath weapon, and his personality. While not related to a specific dragon story, it builds upon powers we already established do relate to dragons, or fit within the realm of creative liberties. 
EXAMPLE TWO - SELKIE
This time let’s play around with a selkie! Described in folklore as seal-shaped fae who can shed their seal skin to walk as human, in this setting the seal shape would serve as inspiration for a mythos form. You are free to make it more fantastical! This character, for example, has thick mane and a crown of horns, as I thought that would be a fun visual for a princely sort of status they have in their family. As far as abilities go, selkie mythology often speaks of enchantment, so that could be a place to start. Water related powers would also make easy sense, but you could poke at further threads. The tide is pulled by the moon; you could have abilities related to the moon or night. Water is required for life to exist; you could play with healing or regenerative powers, things of that nature. These are only some examples of extended thought! Here’s a potential selkie mythos ability set. 
SIREN SONG
Hinrik can enchant others into their influence via singing. They can only charm one person at a time, and the individual will only remain dazed for as long as Hinrik remains primarily focused on them.
OCEAN’S TEARS
Hinrik can mix their tears with any other water to form a prophetic pool. Visions sent may be unclear, but will always have something to do with Hinrik.
SUBMERGED
When fully submerged in water, Hinrik is able to heal minor, relatively recent harm done to their body.
DARK SIDE OF THE MOON
Hinrik can appear invisible when cast in moonlight.
LOST AT SEA
Hinrik can, upon physical contact, make someone feel as if they’re drowning. The illusion ends when Hinrik is no longer in physical contact with who they are affecting, though the transition can be jarring.
EXAMPLE THREE - SANDMAN
Let’s dive into a character that is a little more grandiose in terms of magical flavor. This character is eccentric and often associated with power and performance, so it made more sense to lean into magic that feels ‘bigger’ for lack of a better word. His mythos form is that of a sandman, so I played heavily with abilities related to dreaming, and expanded further and further upon them.
MADE OF SAND
When shifting into mythos form, Faris can take the appearance of any living creature. He will always appear to me made of golden, glittering sand. His usual form is that of a fox.
WELL RESTED
Faris does not need sleep to survive.
GILDED LULLABY
Faris can put someone to sleep by blowing dreamsand he manifests into their face. The length of their slumber depends on the will of the ce chanted individual and how many people Faris currently has under his influence. This effect generally ranges from minutes to a handful of hours.
SLEEPWALKER
Faris can receive the projections of other’s dreams via physical contact. This is easier to do when the subject has been put to sleep by Faris’ own powers.
IMAGINATION THEATER
Faris can shape the dreams of others through his will. He can only do this to one person at a time, and they have to have been put to sleep by Faris’ powers.
