# Concordia Order

This site is built off of **Charadex v.1.5.5**, though it has been heavily modified
to suit the needs of a roleplay group rather than an adoptable/species list.

## ToDo

- Finish styling gallery cards for prompts, items, and timeline entries
- Add a character inventory system for keepsakes earned from prompts
- Adjust the player inventory to see items owned by characters
- Implement the timeline
- Add character creation
